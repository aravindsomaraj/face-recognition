# Face Recognition using FaceNet and SVM

This project implements a deep learning-based face recognition system using the state-of-the-art FaceNet model and an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. It enables the identification of individuals from photographs with high accuracy and robustness.

# Results

The system achieves high accuracy and robustness in recognizing faces, even in challenging conditions such as varying lighting, pose, and facial expressions. The trained SVM classifier effectively distinguishes between different individuals, enabling accurate identification given in the test dataset.
